## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

## How AI Was Used

- Used ChatGPT occasionally to:
  - Debug Flask errors (e.g., 404 issues, incorrect routes).
  - Understand how to structure the Flask app properly.
  - Get help with deployment setup (render.yaml, requirements.txt, Procfile).
  - Clarify usage of tools like `git`, `pip`, and `Postman`.

## My Contribution

- Built the entire URL shortener backend logic myself using Flask.
- Handled route creation, validation, redirection, and analytics features manually.
- Wrote all Python code from scratch in **PyCharm**.
- Independently configured and tested the app for deployment.

## AI Suggestions I Modified or Rejected

- Skipped complex database integrations that were suggested â€” kept the project simple with in-memory storage.
- Modified AI suggestions to match my file structure and logic.
